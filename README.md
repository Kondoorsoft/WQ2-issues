# Wizzerd Quest 2 Reporting

This repository exists as a place to create and track bug reports and feature requests. It also creates a space for the developers to communicate with you on these items.

## How to Report

Navigate to the [Issues](https://github.com/Kondoorsoft/WQ2-issues/issues) tab. Before creating a new bug report or feature request, please check to see if it has already been reported using the search feature. It will be helpful to reference the [Labels](https://github.com/Kondoorsoft/WQ2-issues/labels) we use to categorize reported items. You can also use these labels in your search to help narrow down the results.

If you are unable to find an existing report, you can create a new one by clicking the "New issue" button. You will be presented with a template to fill out. Please fill out as much information as you can to help us understand the issue or feature request.

## Helpful Tips

GitHub's templates support [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), so please feel free to use this syntax to help format your information as you see fit. But please do not change the template's outline or remove any of the sections. While filling out a template, there is a feature that lets you view the formatted version so you can see what it will look like once you submit the report.

### Checkboxes

We may make use of checkboxes in the templates to help you provide information in a structured way. You can check or uncheck these boxes by adding or removing the `x` character inside the brackets. For example, `[x]` is checked, and `[ ]` is unchecked.
